	<p><h3>Welcome to the Canadian electoral barometer. Discover which political party best meets your expectations.</h3>
	<h4>The platforms of the three major parties have been compared on a number of issues You can analyze the platforms by choosing an issue of interest, see how many times the issue is mentionned in each party platform. Based on this, you can then link the party or parties of your choice to this issue and provide your own personal priority for each issue. You can also add an issue not on the list. You can then ask the program to evaluate and combine the issues. In short, you can craft your own personal electoral barometer of the political parties agenda as the next  government. Let's start:</h4>
  		<h5>1. Choose an issue from the list provided or add a new one.</h5>
  		<h5>2. Choose the party or parties that meet your expectations best.</h5>
  		<h5>Put a priority on the chosen issue and click on the 
  		<strong>Evaluate</strong> button.</h5>
  		<h5>Repeat this process with as many issues as you wish. The plausibility of each party as the next government will be reassessed after each addition of a new issue.</h5>
